## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Flask 2.3.3+
- psutil 5.9.5+
- All original MHDDoS dependencies

## Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This dashboard provides web access to DDoS tools. Use responsibly and only on systems you own or have permission to test.

- The dashboard runs on `0.0.0.0:5000` by default (accessible from any IP)
- Consider using a firewall or VPN for additional security
- Change default settings for production use

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port already in use**: Change the port in `app.py` or kill the process using port 5000
2. **Missing dependencies**: Run `pip install -r requirements_dashboard.txt`
3. **start.py not found**: Make sure you're in the MHDDoS directory
4. **Permission denied**: Run with appropriate permissions for your system

### Error Messages

- **"Method Not Found"**: The selected method doesn't exist in MHDDoS
- **"Cannot resolve hostname"**: Check the target URL/IP address
- **"Proxy Check failed"**: Network or proxy configuration issue
